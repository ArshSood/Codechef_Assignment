Pair of Primes
Given an integer n (between 1 and 104) find two prime numbers (possibly same) p1,p2 such that p1+p2=n
In case there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

If there is no solution, then print -1 -1 instead.

Input
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases

First and only line of each testcase contains a single integer n
Output
For each testcase print two space separated primes, p1,p2 such that p1+p2=n
Constraints
1≤T≤104
1≤∑over all testcasesn≤104
Sample Input
3
4
5
1
Sample Output
2 2
2 3
-1 -1
Explanation
2, 3 are both primes numbers and 2 + 2 = 4, 2 + 3 = 5

1 is smaller than every prime number, and so there are no solution in this case, so we have to print -1 -1 instead.
