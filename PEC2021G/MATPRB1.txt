Matrix Classification
Given an n×n square matrix M, figure out if the matrix is

symmetric matrix, i.e. the matrix is equal to it's transpose

triangular matrix, i.e. either all elements in the lower triangle are 0 or all elements in the upper triangle are 0 (excluding the main diagonal)

diagonal matrix, i.e. all non-zero elements lie on the main diagonal

Let s=1 if the matrix is symmetric and 0 otherwise

Let t=1 if the matrix is triangular and 0 otherwise

Let d=1 if the matrix is diagonal and 0 otherwise

Find s+2t+4d
Input
First line contains a single integer T, the number of testcases.

First line of each testcase contains a single integer n the number of rows and columns of the matrix M.

Next n lines, each contain n space separated integers, the elements of the matrix.

The jth integer in the ith row is the value of the element Mij.

Output
For each testcase print a single integer, the value of s+2t+4d as defined in the problem statement
