Sum of Squares in two different ways
Given an integer n, find out if it can be expressed as the sum of squares in two different ways.

For example 50=1+49=25+25
If your solution is n=a2+b2=c2+d2 where a≤b and c≤d and b<d then print a,b,c,d separated by a single space. If there are more than one solution, print the solution with minimum value of d.

If there is no solution print -1 -1 -1 -1 instead.

Note that a,b,c,d should be positive integers (i.e. 0 or negative integers are not allowed).

Input
First line contains a single integer T, the number of testcases.

First line of each testcase contains a singe integer n, the number to be expressed as a sum of squares in two different ways.

Output
Print 4 space separated integers.

If there is no solution then print -1 -1 -1 -1.

Otherwise print four positive integers a,b,c,d such that :

n=a2+b2=c2+d2
a≤b, c≤d
b<d
among all such solutions d is minimum

It can be shown that with the above constraints the answer to be printed is unique.

Constraints
1≤T≤103
1≤n≤104
Sample Input
2
50
1
Sample Output
5 5 1 7
-1 -1 -1 -1
Explanation
For the first testcase 50=52+52=12+72.

For the second testcase clearly there are no solutions since the sum of two positive squares is at least 2.
