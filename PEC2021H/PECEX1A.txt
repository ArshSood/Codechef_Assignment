Given 5 integers, find their median, i.e. the third element when sorted.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases

Each testcase contains a single line with five space separated integers

Output
Print one line for each testcase, the middle element
Constraints
1≤T≤1000
Sample Input
3
5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 1 1 1
Sample Output
3
3
1
Explanation
The sorted arrays are {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4,5} and {1,1,1,1,1} Therefore the answers are 3,3,1
